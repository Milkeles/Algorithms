This is a repository with MY notes. I am writing them to explain things to myself in a simple way. The only reason it's public is because I thought it may be useful to somebody, but it isn't an official learning source or anything, just a collection of random things that I learn. I'm also not promising that I'll publish things here frequently, or at all, or that everything I learn will go in here. It will be mostly things that I consider difficult to remember, as in, I may forget them after a while.
