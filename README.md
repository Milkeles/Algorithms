# Description
This is a repository with MY notes. I am writing them to explain things to myself in a simple way. The only reason it's public is because I thought it may be useful to somebody, but it isn't an official learning source or anything, just a collection of random things that I learn. I'm also not promising that I'll publish things here frequently, or at all, or that everything I learn will go in here. It will be mostly things that I consider difficult to remember, as in, I may forget them after a while, so having notes to re-learn them from would be handy. I may also upload things I help other people with in here because it's easier to format in md files with LaTeX than in Discord or other social network chats. The programming language used may be inconsistent, but I'll try to stick with C++ for the most part. Have fun reading.
